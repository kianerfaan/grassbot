# GrassBot: WiFi-Controlled 3D Printed Grass-Cutting Robot

**Welcome to the GrassBot project repository!**

GrassBot is an open-source, WiFi-controlled, 3D printed grass-cutting robot designed for DIY enthusiasts. This project aims to create an affordable and efficient solution for maintaining small to medium-sized lawns. 

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** 
  - Develop an affordable grass-cutting robot using 3D printing and off-the-shelf components.
  
- **Scope:**
  - Design, prototype, and build a functional robot capable of both autonomous and manual grass cutting with a target budget of $100 per unit.
  
- **Objectives:**
  - Design and build a WiFi-controllable grass-cutting robot.
  - Utilize 3D printing for the main structural components.
  - Implement both manual and basic autonomous operation modes.
  - Complete the project by December 4th.
